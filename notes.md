There are currently 1222 components and 1405 dependent components in the IVM dataset.

Total training time: ~6.5 min (depends on GPU capability)

To do:

Order by confidence
Different sheets for different components (for multiple components at a time)
Add in related component name (alongside description)

Above and beyond:
Possibly use descriptions as headers for each sheet?
Maybe set aside some kind of info sheet for each output?
